# Audio startup and input monitoring (#7)

Verification scheduling: [the testing strategy](../testing/strategy.md) supersedes historical per-slice manual gates in this document. Routine hardware checks belong to #19; automated checks and review gate feature merges.

AudioClient encapsulates AudioContext, microphone ownership, asset loading, AudioWorklet construction, cancellation and cleanup. React calls start, stop and setMonitoring, then subscribes to immutable snapshots. It never creates browser audio nodes or determines sample timing.

Start must be invoked from a user interaction: context creation/resume happens before asynchronous capture/asset setup. Monitoring is false in a new Rust engine instance. Ready is published only after a worklet snapshot confirms that WASM has processed frames. Monitoring state displayed in the UI is acknowledged by the processing side, rather than optimistically redefined in React.

The graph is mono capture (explicit browser downmix), the worklet invoking Rust process, and stereo duplicated output connected to the destination. Two tracks support mono capture and continuous synchronized Loop playback. Rust's public LoopEngine processing and monitoring methods provide the deterministic test seam. Browser infrastructure remains in audio-client and Rust remains browser-independent.

WASM is compiled on the main thread and instantiated during worklet construction. The host creates fixed typed-array views once; the adapter has disjoint 2,048-frame buffers owned by one WASM instance/worklet. WASM calls are serialized. Input is copied, processed and written to both outputs without code-owned periodic allocation or network/DOM/blocking operations in process(). Initialization allocates and zeroes a fixed mono recording buffer before constructing typed-array views, because allocation can grow WASM memory. The sample rate comes from the worklet global. Memory replacement or oversized blocks fail closed.

Commands arrive on the worklet message port; monitoring, REC, PLAY and STOP commands affect subsequent processing blocks. A 100 ms main-thread poll observes frame counters, peak levels monitoring state and track snapshots. Counters are processing diagnostics, not the future shared transport clock. Snapshot objects are created in message handling, outside process(). UI polling never schedules audio.

Stopping cancels the active startup attempt, stops microphone tracks, disconnects the node and closes the context. A late permission response is released and cannot resurrect a canceled session. Page hide/unmount uses the same cleanup. Errors provide permission/device/asset recovery instructions and allow explicit fresh startup. Browser interruptions retain completed recordings, discard unfinished capture, reset transport, and require explicit audio reinitialization; device switching remains #17 work.

Build tools copy Rust WASM and the worklet source into ignored apps/web/public/audio assets before dev/build. The source worklet lives in packages/audio-client. Rebuild audio assets after Rust/worklet changes during development. Assets use Vite BASE_URL for hosted subdirectories.

Verification: native known-sample monitoring tests and production-preview browser tests for the real bridge, explicit monitoring, reset on restart, injected browser permission denial with real successful retry, missing WASM and canceled delayed real capture. Fake Chromium media is not hardware listening evidence. The #5/#6 accepted manual feasibility tests informed this implementation; the #7 production device checklist was completed by the user. Routine physical checks for subsequent slices are deferred to #19 under the testing strategy; an earlier targeted check requires a concrete hardware-only uncertainty or regression. No unmeasured latency/glitch or Safari/mobile support claim is made.

## First Loop recording and playback (#8)

LoopEngine hides the capture buffer behind record(trackId), process() and snapshot(). REC on Empty enters Recording immediately; REC on Recording establishes the exact captured sample length and begins Playing at position zero. A zero-sample completion returns Empty. REC on Playing now begins overdub (#11). Input absence contributes zero-valued samples. The engine advances and wraps position per output sample, independent of block partitioning and React updates. The worklet duplicates each mono output sample into both channels.

A 60-second recording buffer per track is allocated once at the active sample rate (4 bytes × sample rate × 60: 11.52 MB per track, 23.04 MB for two tracks at 48 kHz, excluding WASM overhead). No buffer grows or allocates in process or record. Reaching capacity completes capture after writing the last sample; playback begins with the following sample. The remaining-time UI and track/global STOP/PLAY semantics are implemented in #9. Supported initialization rates are 8–192 kHz; unsupported rates fail startup with recovery guidance.

Monitoring remains separate: capture works when monitoring is off, and recorded playback remains audible when monitoring is off. Monitor input and playback are summed, then output is clamped to [-1, 1] without modifying stored samples. This provisional output protection is deterministic, not a transparent limiter or a measured performance claim; mixer work can revisit it with evidence.

Snapshots expose state, captured length, capacity, command availability and shared transport state/position. UI progress uses the acknowledged position without scheduling playback. Stop audio closes and discards the session, including its temporary recording; this is different from track/global transport STOP, which preserve completed recordings. Interruption recovery preserves completed recordings but disconnects the input and resets the transport until explicit reinitialization. The UI explains this distinction.

Verification includes literal sample fixtures across irregular block boundaries, zero-length completion, capacity completion, monitoring mix/clamp and thousands of cycles. A production UI test uses AudioClient through the actual WASM/worklet; an offline known-sample test crosses the real processing adapter and compares both output channels sample-for-sample. Physical listening for this slice is deferred to #19 (M02/M09) for perceptual boundary artifacts, latency and dropouts; no physical pass is claimed.

## Recording bounds and transport controls (#9)

The Rust engine has one private Transport with running state, an integer sample position and shared cycle length. All advancement is per processed output sample. Completing first capture via REC or at capacity establishes the cycle, enters Playing and sets position zero for the next output sample. Completing it via Track STOP retains the same exact samples and cycle but leaves both track and transport stopped. Zero-sample completion remains Empty.

Track STOP during playback enters Stopped without stopping transport; the timeline and displayed shared cycle phase continue even when every track is silent. PLAY on Stopped joins that phase. If transport is stopped, PLAY restarts it at zero and starts only the selected track (verified across both tracks in #10). PLAY while already Playing has no effect. No track-local clock is introduced.

Global STOP preserves completed audio/cycle, stops the track and resets transport position to zero. During unfinished first capture, it discards captured length and returns Empty with no cycle; stale buffer contents are unreachable and overwritten by the next capture. Monitoring is unchanged: transport STOP governs recorded playback/capture, not live input monitoring or browser resource ownership. Stop audio still closes and discards the session.

## Interruption recovery (#18)

`LoopEngine.interrupt()` is the real-time boundary for browser audio interruptions. It stops transport, disables monitoring, discards any unfinished initial capture, and retains completed loops and completed overdub additions. `AudioClient` invokes it when the input track ends/mutes or the `AudioContext` changes state, disconnects the browser input, and publishes an `interrupted` status. Recovery is explicit: the user selects **Reinitialize audio**, which requests a fresh input stream, reconnects the existing worklet, and reports `ready` only after processing resumes. Playback is never started automatically after an interruption.

Rust snapshots provide command availability, and the UI combines those flags only with browser readiness. REC on retained audio is available for overdub while transport runs; an established stopped cycle cannot record. Remaining capacity is calculated from engine capacity minus captured sample length, divided by the browser sample rate. The UI rounds for display only; timers never complete capture. Capacity completion writes the final sample before switching to playback, even mid-block.

Native tests exercise public commands/process/snapshot with exact samples and the 60-second boundary at 8, 44.1, 48 and 96 kHz. Production browser tests cross AudioClient and the real WASM/worklet for stop/restart/retention and remaining capacity; offline 8 kHz rendering verifies a full 60-second capture followed by identical stereo playback. Routine physical checks M03/M09 are deferred to #19 under the shared testing strategy. No latency or glitch guarantee is inferred from offline rendering.

## Second synchronized Loop (#10)

One LoopEngine owns two private Track buffers and a single Transport. Track-indexed REC/PLAY/STOP commands use zero-based IDs 0/1; invalid indices and unavailable commands are ignored. Either track can establish the first cycle. Rust enforces one active capture, including stale competing REC messages; other playback and independent monitoring continue.

With an established running cycle, REC on an empty track saves the current phase and captures into corresponding cycle positions, including wraparound. Capture completes after one full elapsed cycle, not at the next boundary. REC completion begins phase-aligned playback; Track STOP retains a full-cycle recording but leaves that track stopped and the transport advancing. Completion never resets an existing transport. Global STOP discards unfinished capture, retains completed tracks/cycle and resets the shared timeline; subsequent PLAY starts only the selected track at zero.

The engine retains capture start/count internally. Playback treats positions outside that captured interval as silence, so discarded audio cannot leak into a shorter retry. This avoids allocating or clearing an entire buffer in a command or processing callback. No UI caller needs buffer layout knowledge. Snapshots expose both tracks' recording length, captured sample count, storage capacity, capture limit, phase and command availability. Capture limit is 60 seconds before cycle establishment and one shared cycle afterward; remaining time derives from limit minus elapsed captured samples, not phase.

Native fixtures verify full-cycle wraparound, early REC/STOP, retry silence, capture ownership, either track establishing the cycle, selected-track restart, output protection and thousands of synchronized cycles. The four-second/two-second-start/one-second phrase example is tested at 8 kHz in Rust and 8,192 Hz through the actual production worklet/WASM. The offline browser rate aligns each whole-second command with its 128-frame suspension boundary. Browser interactions verify both control sets, exclusion, automatic completion and selected-track restart. Physical cases M04/M09 remain deferred to #19; offline checks do not establish hardware latency or glitch performance.

## Immediate additive overdub (#11)

Overdubbing is an explicit engine state. REC on Playing begins immediately; REC on Stopped begins synchronized playback plus overdub only while Transport runs. REC on Overdubbing returns Playing. Track/global STOP retain additions and enter Stopped; Global STOP resets the shared timeline. Initial capture and overdub share the same exclusive ownership rule, enforced by Rust even for stale competing commands.

Each overdub sample adds input to stored audio at the current cycle position, stores the full sum, and contributes it to output. Existing audio has 100% feedback; length and shared clock do not change. Final summed output, including independent monitoring, uses the existing hard clamp [-1, 1]. This deterministic protection can distort overload; it is not a transparent limiter. Stored sums are not clipped, as native and actual WASM tests demonstrate by adding above unity then subtracting to recover the original samples.

Private LoopBuffer storage uses one preallocated validity word (64 sample bits plus capture generation) per 64 samples. A fresh capture increments generation in constant time; its first write to a word lazily resets that word. Reads of unwritten/currently invalid samples return silence; overdub can fill any hole without resurrecting discarded input. No full-buffer clear, allocation or growth occurs in REC/process. Both 60-second mono tracks at 48 kHz require approximately 24.48 MB for samples plus validity metadata, excluding WASM/host overhead (23.04 MB samples, 1.44 MB metadata). These are predictable storage costs, not measured latency guarantees.

Verification covers multi-cycle full-volume sums, partial track/global STOP retention, stopped-track phase entry, cross-track exclusion, sparse capture retry across validity words, and stored versus output clipping. Browser controls and known-sample offline WASM/worklet rendering verify state, commands and stereo output. Physical cases M05/M09 remain deferred to #19 under the shared testing policy.

## Independent One-shot capture and playback (#12)

Each track has an engine-owned playback mode. Empty tracks can select Loop or One-shot through AudioClient.setMode and the worklet; snapshots acknowledge mode and command availability. Retained recording conversion is implemented in #13 and CLEAR/reset are implemented in #15. React displays availability and sends commands rather than maintaining another state machine.

One-shot capture writes sequentially from zero regardless of shared cycle length/position. REC completion or the sample-exact 60-second capacity completes the recording and starts playback on the following sample from position zero. Track STOP finishes capture without playback. Global STOP discards unfinished capture while retaining completed recordings and the existing cycle. A zero-sample finish returns Empty and can retry.

One-shot playback owns a private sample cursor within the same engine, advances once per processed output sample and stops immediately after its final recorded sample. PLAY resets that cursor to zero, including while Playing; it never starts, changes or follows Loop transport. Global STOP stops One-shots even when Loop transport is already stopped, and the UI keeps that action available during independent capture/playback. Monitoring remains independent of transport STOP.

Only one capture/overdub is available across both modes. Completed One-shots reject REC and never overdub; their audio can be retriggered until CLEAR is implemented. The agreed session rule still disables new REC when an established Loop cycle has stopped; Loop PLAY restarts it. No new allocations occur during capture/playback, and existing preallocated storage is reused.

Verification: six native public-interface tests cover independent duration, exact samples/end/retrigger, capture exclusion, retained/discarded STOP outcomes, the 60-second boundary and zero-length retry. Three production browser tests cover visible controls, real WASM/worklet one-pass stereo output at capacity and independent capture longer than a running Loop cycle. Routine physical listening remains deferred to #19 (M06/M09); no device pass or latency guarantee is claimed.

## Safe retained playback-mode changes (#13)

Mode changes preserve stored samples and require Empty or Stopped state. The engine exposes canSetMode and canSetLoop; React disables the selector during capture/playback/overdub and disables Loop selection with a length explanation when retained audio does not exactly match an established shared cycle. Commands are checked again in Rust, so stale UI messages cannot bypass eligibility.

Converting a stopped recording changes neither transport nor cycle. One-shot playback resets its private cursor and starts from zero. Converted Loop PLAY joins the current shared phase; when no cycle exists, PLAY establishes the recording's exact sample length and starts only that track. REC on that converted Loop instead establishes the cycle at zero and immediately begins additive overdub. If two recordings converted before any cycle exists have different lengths, establishing one cycle makes the incompatible retained Loop unavailable for PLAY/REC; it can still convert back to One-shot.

Five native fixtures cover retained samples, active-state rejection, exact compatibility, phase joining, cycle establishment on PLAY/REC and compatibility after another track establishes the cycle. Three production browser cases verify acknowledged selector availability/length explanation and sample-exact retained overdub/One-shot output through actual WASM. Physical M06/M09 remain deferred to #19.

## Timing-independent mixing (#14)

Track gain and mute affect only each track's output contribution. Recording/overdub stores incoming samples at full input volume; mute never pauses capture or either playback cursor. Muted One-shots reach Stopped at their normal sample end. Live monitoring remains independent of track mute.

Master gain multiplies the sum of track contributions and live monitoring before the existing hard clamp to [-1, 1]. Track/master gains accept finite linear values from 0 to 1 (defaults 1); mute defaults off. Invalid values and track IDs are ignored. No gain smoothing or transparent limiter is claimed. Controls send commands through AudioClient; slider percentages and mute state reflect acknowledged engine snapshots. Settings persistence belongs to #16.

Four native known-sample fixtures verify mathematical gains, master-before-clamp, unmodified stored audio, mute phase/capture/overdub and One-shot completion. Two production browser cases verify controls and sample-exact stereo output through actual worklet/WASM. Physical cases M07/M09 remain deferred to #19, including perceptual clicks/overload behavior.

## Safe CLEAR and session reset (#15)

CLEAR ends the selected track's playback/capture, drops its length/count/cursor and returns Empty without altering the cycle or other track. It preserves mode, volume and mute preferences. No buffer is cleared or allocated: the next REC starts a new validity generation, preventing stale audio from reappearing. Clearing every track still preserves the shared cycle. Explicit reset clears all tracks and replaces transport with an empty stopped timeline, while preserving mode/volume/mute settings and resetting monitoring off for the fresh workspace.

Confirmation defaults on. A native modal dialog allows audio processing to continue until Confirm; Cancel/Escape sends no engine command. The page setting can disable/re-enable confirmation; persistence is #16. Reset uses the same confirmation preference and names its broader removal explicitly. All accepted commands are executed through the production worklet, and controls reflect engine acknowledgement.

Three native fixtures cover clear during capture/overdub/One-shot, ownership release, retained cycle/settings, stale-free reuse and reset/new length. Three production browser cases cover confirm/cancel/ongoing transport, immediate clear/re-enable/rerecord and exact stereo output retaining another track until reset. Physical M07/M09 remain deferred to #19.
