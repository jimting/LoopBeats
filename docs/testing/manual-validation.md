# Shared physical-audio validation

Owner: the project's one manual tester. Tracker: [#19](https://github.com/ty-jt-agent/LoopBeats/issues/19). Follow [strategy.md](strategy.md). This catalog covers the first usable two-track desktop milestone, not the later five-track/cross-device product.

## Run once, reuse setup

Use desktop Chrome, a working microphone and wired headphones. Open the candidate build and record the setup below. Start audio once; keep monitoring off except where required. Cases can share the same recordings and session. Never turn a deferred checkbox into a claimed pass.

| ID | Combined case and expected outcome | Origin / affected features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M01 | Start and allow capture; monitoring is initially off. Toggle it on/off and confirm live input is heard only when enabled. Stop/restart the audio session and confirm resource release and monitoring reset. Deny permission once, confirm actionable recovery, then allow/retry. | #7; lifecycle, routing, permissions |
| M02 | Record a distinctive phrase on A, finish with REC, hear repeated content from the beginning in both outputs. Progress wraps and length remains fixed. Listen for unintended missing/repeated samples, clicks or dropouts. Distinguish waveform discontinuity clicks from timing errors. | #8; first Loop and output bridge |
| M03 | Verify first-recording track STOP retains audio silently; PLAY begins it. Verify the displayed 60-second limit/remaining time and automatic completion once. Individual track STOP preserves the running cycle; global STOP resets transport, retains completed audio and discards unfinished initial capture. | #9; bounds and transport |
| M04 | With A looping, record B halfway through the cycle. Verify equal length and audible phase alignment. Finish another synchronized capture early and confirm uncaptured positions are silent; retry across wraparound. | #10; synchronized capture |
| M05 | Overdub A across multiple cycles, finish mid-cycle, then stop/play. Additions are retained, length unchanged. Competing REC is unavailable. | #11; overdub and capture ownership |
| M06 | Record a One-shot, hear it once then stop; PLAY retriggers from zero. Check mode changes while stopped and rejection of incompatible Loop length. | #12–#13; One-shot and modes |
| M07 | Adjust track/master gain, mute/unmute while playing/capturing and confirm phase/capture continues. Listen for unexpected overload behavior. Verify CLEAR confirm/cancel/off setting; clearing preserves cycle and session reset removes it. | #14–#15; mixer and clear/reset |
| M08 | Change supported settings, reload and confirm settings persist while recordings do not. Confirm leave-page warning with recordings. With an available second input, switch only while stopped and verify retained completed audio/fallback. Trigger an available real interruption/disconnect and verify retained completed audio plus explicit recovery. Record unavailable hardware paths as blocked, not passed. | #16–#18; settings and lifecycle |
| M09 | Run the integrated two-track Loop/overdub mix for 10 minutes. During the same run exercise realistic main-thread/UI load for at least 30 seconds and watch progress. Note audible drift/dropouts, input/output delay and reported diagnostics. No numeric latency guarantee is inferred from listening. | #19; integrated stability and UI isolation |
| M10 | Export/import a distinctive two-track session. During Loop, One-shot and overdub capture wait for a recovery checkpoint, reload and explicitly recover. Confirm retained partial audio opens stopped, monitoring off, Loop phase/silent gaps retained and no resumed capture. Listen under UI load while checkpoints transfer; verify global STOP discards initial capture and recovery warns about unsaved newer work. | #50–#54; portable sessions and partial recovery; deferred to #19 |

At #19, map all 50 parent stories to automated or manual evidence. These combined cases complement that trace; they do not replace story-specific deterministic tests. If required hardware is unavailable, #19 stays unaccepted unless the owner explicitly narrows the target and records the limitation.

## Existing evidence and deferred work

| Evidence | Status | Reuse / limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #5 browser audio spike | User-reported manual acceptance | Historical feasibility; use its research record, not a new mandatory per-PR run. |
| #6 WASM gain spike / PR #24 | User-reported manual acceptance | Historical feasibility, not integrated loop correctness. |
| M01 / #7 / PR #26 | Device checklist marked complete by user | Browser/hardware details were not recorded in the PR discussion. Reuse for intermediate slices; run once on the final candidate. |
| M02 / #8 / PR #27 | Deferred to #19 | Automated recording/stereo-output evidence passed; physical listening has not been performed/reported. |
| M03–M09 | Pending milestone implementation/validation | No pass is claimed. |

## Results format

Store run reports in this directory as `run-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (add a suffix for a second run that day), or link an equivalent #19 issue attachment/comment. Use one setup header for all cases in the run:

- Date / tester:
- Commit SHA / build URL:
- OS / browser version:
- Input / output hardware and connection (wired/USB/etc.):
- Sample rate and available latency diagnostics:

| Case ID | Result: passed / failed / deferred / blocked | Observation or diagnostic link | Bug / follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M02 | deferred | Not yet performed | #19 |

The row above is an example of deferred status, not a completed test run. Reports must record actual observations. Separate estimated/perceived delay from measured values; do not invent metrics.

## Retest selection

Each PR lists affected IDs. A known failure gets one short reproduction and a linked bug. After its fix, rerun that case and any dependent cases (for example, a playback timing fix can affect M02–M06 and M09), using the previous setup when appropriate. For documentation-only changes, no listening is required. Do not rerun already accepted permission/monitoring cases for a recording-only slice without a concrete regression reason.
